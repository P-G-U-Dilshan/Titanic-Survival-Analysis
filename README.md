# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

This is my first end-to-end data analysis project, built using Python. I analyzed the famous Titanic dataset to understand *what* key factors contributed most to a passenger's survival.

The entire analysis—from loading the data, cleaning it, analyzing it, and visualizing the results—is contained in the main Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic.ipynb`).

## 📊 Key Findings & Visualizations

My analysis answered three main questions, and the findings were very clear:

### 1. Gender: "Women and Children First" Was Real
A passenger's gender was the strongest predictor of survival.
* **Women:** ~74% Survival Rate
* **Men:** ~19% Survival Rate

### 2. Passenger Class: Money Mattered
Survival chances were directly linked to a passenger's ticket class.
* **1st Class:** ~63% Survival Rate
* **2nd Class:** ~47% Survival Rate
* **3rd Class:** ~24% Survival Rate

### 3. Age: The Young Were Spared
Children under 10 had a much higher chance of survival than any other age group. Conversely, young adults (age 20-35) had the lowest survival rate.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **Python:** The core language for the analysis.
* **Pandas:** Used for loading the data, cleaning (handling `NaN` values), and analysis (`groupby`).
* **Matplotlib:** Used to create all the visualizations (Bar Charts and Histograms).
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment used to write and present the code.
